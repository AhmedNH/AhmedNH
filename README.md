# Hi, I'm a Computer Science Honors Student at York University 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science Honors student with a strong interest in **systems programming, backend engineering, and low-level performance-aware software design**.

My work focuses on building core abstractions from first principles — memory management, data structures, runtime interfaces, and clean APIs — with an emphasis on correctness, efficiency, and clarity.

---

## 🔧 Technical Interests

- Operating systems & memory management
- Low-level C programming and pointer semantics
- Data structures and recursive algorithms
- Backend and API design in Java
- Systems performance and correctness

---

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Virtual Memory MMU Simulator (C)
Simulated a full memory management unit with TLB caching, demand paging, and LRU replacement, modeling logical-to-physical address translation and analyzing page fault behavior.

### 🔹 Generic Linked-Node Tree Structures (Java)
Implemented generic tree data structures using linked nodes, supporting recursive traversal and aggregation without arrays or standard collections.

### 🔹 Pointer Arrays & Command-Line Processing (C)
Built memory-efficient pointer-based data manipulation and runtime command-line interfaces, emphasizing pointer semantics and function boundaries.

## 🎯 What I Care About

- Writing code that explains itself
- Understanding systems beneath abstractions
- Designing APIs that enforce correctness
- Trading convenience for clarity when it matters

I'm actively seeking **software engineering internships** where I can contribute to systems, backend, or performance-critical software.
